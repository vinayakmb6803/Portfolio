Developed a deep learning model using CNNs to accurately distinguish between individuals with and without glasses, addressing challenges like facial variations, lighting inconsistencies, and occlusions. Applied image augmentation to enhance robustness and optimized model parameters to improve classification accuracy. The final model showed strong performance across various evaluation metrics.
